# 🎁 drop.droo

**A tiny case-opening simulator built with pure chaotic energy.**  
No frameworks. No backends. Just HTML, CSS, JS.

## 🧠 What is this?

`drop.droo` is a case-opening simulator where you:

- Crack open cases 🎰
- Get random skins 💥
- Collect them in your **inventory** 🧳
- Sell them for pretend money 💸
- And feel either **incredibly lucky** or **deeply betrayed** 🙃

It’s like CS:GO cases... but without the cost, addiction, or regret. Just fun.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 💻 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- ⚙️ JavaScript
- 📦 JSON (for storing them items)

## ✨ Features

- 🎡 **Case opening spinner** — pure dopamine roulette
- 📦 **Inventory system** — your own private loot museum
- 💰 **Sell items** — so you can go again (capitalism, baby)
- 😎 **No login, no database, no cloud** — just upload `index.html` and go

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Download the repo.
2. Upload `index.html` onto a apache server or just use live-server.

## 📜 License

MIT License.  
Do whatever you want with this — remix it, clone it, use it in your portfolio, teach your grandma JavaScript.  
Crediting me is nice but not required.  
Stealing it and claiming it's yours makes you a certified *flaskhals* — that’s what we call you in Sweden.

---

## 💬 Final Words

This project was made just for fun over a day of coding.  
If you like it — cool.  
If you want to improve it — fork away.  
If it crashes your browser — that’s a skill issue.

Enjoy cracking cases, legend.
